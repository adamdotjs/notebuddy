// Models are database interfaces that let you interact with the DB API to create schemas, etc.
// Views are what compile and render into plain HTML that gets displayed on the client/browser.
// Controllers handle the requests from the client and return responses that could either be API data or pushing views.
// Routers handle incoming requests from the browser and maps those requests to specific controllers.
